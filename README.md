# 8-bit-processor-for-Cryptography
The processor is designed to perform encryption, decryption, and control operations. Verilog HDL was used for hardware description and simulation and synthesis were performed using Xilinx Vivado. The project aims to explore the fundamental principles of processor design and FPGA-based implementation.
